An implementation of the Red-Black Tree data structure in C. The interface
is designed to be simple to use and generic.

1. Background

The Red-Black Tree is a balanced binary search tree data structure.

2. Necessary Improvements.


(A) Implement iterator for the tree. This will make it easier to work
with the pointers stored in the tree.

(B) Implement a more robust error system. Right now we use a simple
function that displays a given message and shuts down the program if
any error states occur. This can be made more elegant.

(C) Further modularization of the code, i.e. further separation of interface
and implementation would be necessary here.

(D) Smaller improvements like using const when appropriate.
